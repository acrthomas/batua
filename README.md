This is a working repository for organizing the data collected for my MA Linguistics thesis, _The Emerging Prosodic System(s) of Bilbao-Area Standard Basque_.

The intention is to slap together a functional site / shiny dashboard that will make it easier to visualize both raw data and the analysis run on said data. Any eventual visualization will then be linked to on my academic website (pharyngeals.github.io)
